This is the Open Source Community Version of my Discord Bot Toast!!! Some Features may be missing because either it does not fit this bot or I want to keep them Private!

## When does the First Version come out?
It will be released alongside the full version 1.0 of Toast. Updates will always be released together with Toast updates, typically every few months. Feedback is very important to me. Please make sure your feedback is constructive; non-constructive criticism will not be considered.

See you soon!<br>
